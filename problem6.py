#The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
#1**2+2**2+...+10**2=385
#The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
#(1+2+...+10)**2=55**2=3025
#Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025âˆ’385=2640.
#Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
